# sorting_algorithm_analysis

The purpose of this study was to compare the run-times of common sorting algorithms on two separate data structures, with 4 different data sizes. Included files:
* [ArrayListUnsorted](ArrayListUnsorted.java) - an unsorted array list to test sorting algorithm runtimes on.
* [ArrayListSorted](ArrayListSorted.java) - a sorted array list to test sorting algorithm runtimes on.
* [LinkedListUnsorted](LinkedListUnsorted.java) - an unsorted linked list to test sorting algorithm runtimes on.
* [LinkedListSorted](LinkedListSorted.java) - a sorted linked list to test sorting algorithm runtimes on.
* [MyRunner](MyRunner.java) - driver file that implements and tests the collections and sorting methods.

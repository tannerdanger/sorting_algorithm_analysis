# sorting_algorithm_analysis

The purpose of this study was to compare the run-times of common sorting algorithms on two separate data structures, with 4 different data sizes. Included files:
* [ArrayListUnsorted.java](ArrayListUnsorted) - an unsorted array list to test sorting algorithm runtimes on.
* [ArrayListSorted.java](ArrayListSorted) - a sorted array list to test sorting algorithm runtimes on.
* [LinkedListUnsorted.java](LinkedListUnsorted) - an unsorted linked list to test sorting algorithm runtimes on.
* [LinkedListSorted.java](LinkedListSorted) - a sorted linked list to test sorting algorithm runtimes on.
* [MyRunner.java](MyRunner) - driver file that implements and tests the collections and sorting methods.
